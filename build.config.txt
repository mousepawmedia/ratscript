# Build Configuration Template (MousePaw Media Build System)
# Version: 3.2.1

##### PATH CONFIGURATIONS ######
#
# Make a copy of this file and save it in the root of the repository
# with a name ending in ".config". Then modify as necessary.
#
# The repository is configured to ignore all .config files, with the
# exception of default.config (which should never be modified).
#
# ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY} is a special variable which points to
# the directory containing the CMakeLists.txt file being built from.
# Relative paths should always begin with this variable.
#
# To use a configuration file with make, specify it in the 'make' command via
# "make <target> CONFIG=<name>", where '<name>' is the first part of the
# file name (before the .config). For example, "make library CONFIG=foo"
# would build the library (release target) using "foo.config".
#
# To use a configuration file with CMake directly, specify it by passing the
# argument "-DCONFIG_FILENAME=<name>", where '<name>' is the first part of the
# file name (before the .config). For example, passing the argument
# "-DCONFIG_FILENAME=foo" would build using "foo.config".
#
##### WHERE TO FIND DEPENDENCIES #####
#
# Specify the path to the dependencies. The default is to look for
# dependencies in the specified repositories adjacent to this repository.
# You may need run the appropriate make commands on said repositories first.

##### LLVM LIBC++ #####
#
# This option asks the Clang compiler to use LLVM's libc++ library.
# The build system will look for this library in the system paths.
#
# If you are not compiling with Clang, this option will be ignored.
# NOTE: libc++ is already used by default on Mac.
#
# Set the option to either `true` or `false` below.
