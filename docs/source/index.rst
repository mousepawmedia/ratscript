Ratscript Documentation
######################################

**Ratscript** is a programming language based on the idea that a programming
language should be *intentionally designed*. It embraces the goals that the
language should resemble *common logic* more than *computer logic*, have a
shallow initial learning curve to make it easy to grasp by non-programmers, and
should foster conscientious programming habits, encouraging less-experienced
programmers to default to safer and more effective methods and algorithms.

See Ratscript's ``README.md``, ``CHANGELOG.md``, ``BUILDING.md``, and
``LICENSE.md`` for more technical information.
